# Public Oil & Gas Data

### FracFocus
FracFocus.org is a site for voluntary (except in some states) disclosure of chemicals, additives, and volumes used in hydraulic fracturing. Data quality and coverage is hit-and-miss, but it's one of the few public sources for detailed frac-design data.

An environmental group carried out some heavy data munging to get the FracFocus set (up to May 2013) into a more usable form:

### UT Lands
The University of Texas system holds land and mineral rights to large areas in West Texas. This site allows access to production data, maps, and digitized well logs for wells on these lands.

### State Regulatory Agencies
Many state regulatory agencies in the U.S. maintain online databases and query systems for oil and gas well data. These can be tedious to access by hand, but offer a rich source of potentially-scrapable data.
